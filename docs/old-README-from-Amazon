This script is a wrapper around curl, a popular command line http client, that
will calculate the authentication parameters for the request.

To get an object, you would run:

./s3curl.pl --id=[aws-access-key-id] --key=[aws-secret-access-key] -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]/[key-name]


The arguments after the '--' are passed through to curl, so you could put any
curl specific options there, and then the url you are trying to get.

To put an object, run:

./s3curl.pl --id=[aws-access-key-id] --key=[aws-secret-access-key] --put=<file-name> -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]/[key-name]

To delete an object:

./s3curl.pl --id=[aws-access-key-id] --key=[aws-secret-access-key] --delete -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]/[key-name]


To list a bucket:

./s3curl.pl --id=[aws-access-key-id] --key=[aws-secret-access-key] -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]

To create a bucket:

./s3curl.pl --id=[aws-access-key-id] --key=[aws-secret-access-key] --put=/dev/null -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]

To delete a bucket:

./s3curl.pl --id=[aws-access-key-id] --key=[aws-secret-access-key] --delete -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]


SECURITY CONSIDERATION:

On a shared system, it is dangerous to specify your AWS Secret Access Key on
the command line, as any other user on the machine can view your command line.
It would be prudent to instead hard-code your security credentials and change
permissions on the script to be non-world-readable.  An even better solution
would be to find some way to encrypt your security credentials, but this is
beyond the scope of this example.
