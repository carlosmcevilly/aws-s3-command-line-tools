Carlos McEvilly's Amazon S3 Convenience Scripts
===============================================

This package contains a set of convenience scripts to make it easier to
use Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service). See below for both quick start
and detailed instructions.

Please see the file LICENSES for information on copyrights and licenses.

= Quick Start =

The scripts have self-explanatory names and take the obvious arguments.
Install the dependencies, set the aws_id and aws_key environment
variables, and you're ready to go. More detailed info is below.

= Why another set of S3 scripts? =

There are plenty of small S3 convenience projects out there, so why
another one? My goal with these scripts was to:

* Make the simple even more simple (no unneeded options or features)
* Simple operations that just do their job: put, get, delete, etc.
* Focus strictly on getting things done from the command line
* Require less typing, and easy-to-remember, consistent command syntax
* No switches or options, just s3-put or s3-get <bucketname> <filename>
* Run on both UNIX (including OS X) and Windows
* Require only a minimal set of free software and libraries

= Dependencies and Setup =

You'll need the following installed on your system:

Curl (it's free; search for Curl download)
Perl (built in on UNIX; for Windows, get it from activeperl.com)
Perl modules: Digest::HMAC_SHA1, MIME::Base64, Getopt::Long

On UNIX, get and install the Perl modules from the command line using CPAN:

perl -MCPAN -e install Digest::HMAC_SHA1
perl -MCPAN -e install MIME::Base64
perl -MCPAN -e install Getopt::Long

On Windows, use ppm, which comes with ActiveState's Perl. From a
Windows command prompt window, do:

ppm
> install Digest-HMAC_SHA1
> install MIME-Base64
> install Getopt-Long
> exit

= Setting your ID and Key =

You'll need an ID and key from Amazon, which you get by going to
http://aws.amazon.com/ and signing up for an Amazon Web Services
(AWS) S3 account.

To make best use of the S3 scripts, create two environment variables,
aws_id and aws_key (lower case) containing your ID and your key for
Amazon Web Services. You can use the tools without doing this, but
then you would have to put your AWS credentials on the command line,
which is a lot of typing and is also a bit worse from a security
perspective.

= Installation =

Simply copy both s3curl.pl and all the script files from the directory
for your platform (unix or mswin) to a directory that is on your path.

= Scripts To Use =

s3-mkb <bucketname>                    make a bucket
s3-rmb <bucketname>                    remove a bucket
s3-dir <bucketname>                    list contents of a bucket
s3-put <bucketname> <filename>         upload a file into a bucket
s3-get <bucketname> <filename>         download a file from a bucket
s3-del <bucketname> <filename>         delete a file from a bucket

= xmlformat =

The xmlformat tool is a wrapper around a Perl utility called xmlpretty,
also available from CPAN. Get xmlpretty from CPAN and then you can do
this:

s3-dir <bucketname> | xmlformat

The output of your bucket listing will then be nicely formatted for
easy reading.

= Enhancements made to s3curl.pl =

* fixed buggy handling of key and id arguments
* tool now detects and sets the file type on image uploads
